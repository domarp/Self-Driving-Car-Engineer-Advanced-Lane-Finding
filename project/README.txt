This folder contains scripts related to this project
    - image_utils.py : This module contains all the image utility functions such as image sharpening, camera calibration, undistortion, binary image creation, perspective transformations, filling polygons and creating final frames
    - lane_utlis.py : This module contains all the lane utility functions such as finding the lane lines, fiting a polynomial function to the lane points, measuring the radius of curvature and distance from centre
    - project2_advanced_lane_finding.ipynb : This is the main notebook which contains the pipeline definitions for image and video lane finding algorithms. A pipeline typically calls in various image and lane finding utility functions to detect lanes in images or videos
    
Along with the above modules the writeup of this project has also been placed in this same folder (in both *.ipynb and *.pdf formats)
